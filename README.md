# rg35xx-blank-ui
Blank UI for stock RG35xx+, this is setup in the same way that the partition on the stock OS. To use these files you'll still need to be able to run a Virtual Machine of Linux to view and overwrite the files.

This is completely blank png's and jpg's. It's not recommended to upload this straight as is but instead modify the images to what UI you want to see.

This is only recommended for people that have looked into modifying the OS already, for a better write-up please see  u/Personal_Argument344's write-up here:
